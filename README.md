# Container-based Microservices through Docker and Kubernetes

This is a repository of essential files that I created for my internship at GIST from October to December 2020.

[ffmpeg](https://github.com/briankim113/gist-internship/tree/main/ffmpeg) folder contains code for the FFmpeg-based video streaming microservice I created through Docker and deployed in a local Kubernetes cluster.

[dashboard](https://github.com/briankim113/gist-internship/tree/main/dashboard) folder contains code for various config and script files for easily starting and stopping Kubernetes Dashboard that monitors the health of the cluster on Web UI.

I drafted a 40-page final technical report in Korean, outlining the importance of microservices and container orchestration as well as a step-by-step process to try out the demo.
The report was presented to my supervising GIST Professor and the National Information Agency of South Korea.
For the copy of the report, please email me at hk2473@nyu.edu.
